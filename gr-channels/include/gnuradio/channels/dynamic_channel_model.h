     * be used to help evaluate, design, and test various signals,
     * waveforms, and algorithms. This model allows the user to set
     * the voltage of an AWGN noise source, a (normalized) frequency
     * offset, a sample timing offset, and a noise seed to randomize
     * the AWGN noise source.
     *
     * Multipath can be approximated in this model by using a FIR
     * filter representation of a multipath delay profile..

       *                the transmitter and receiver. 1.0 is no difference.
